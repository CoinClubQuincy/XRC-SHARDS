# A New Type of Token: SHARDS & SPLITS

  

Most are familiar with NFTs as decentralized Objects that show ownership of an item or to keep a unit of account of an Item. NFTs can be a representative of anything, even a DApp. Today I made a proposal to the XDC-Community [XIP Proposal](https://github.com/XDC-Community/XDC-Community.github.io) to standardize a new type of token. This token is an NFT that represents ownership over a DApp and will take the incoming funds and distribute them among the token holders. Developers can also use these NFTs within their application to give the SHARDS governance capabilities like access control and voting rights by defining the tokens in the code itself.

  

There are 2 types of SHARDS, SHARDS and SPLITS. SHARDS act as a share of a DApp that receives the dividends based on its performance while SPLITS are a Share of a SHARD ade receives the yield of the original SHARD while splitting the dividends again amongst a set of derivative token holders.

  

SHARDs are not a crypto currency but a native crypto asset to a native crypto application the performance and relative value of the SHARD is predicated on the growth and use of the DApp and the accumulated fees that act as a yield for the Token holders.

  

SHARDS specifications:

-   A DApp can have a max of 1000 SHARDS
    
-   Each SHARD has its own account in the contract and the holder of the token can redeem any yield from that tokens account
    

  

SHARDS specifications:

-   SPLITS have the same amount of splits per SHARD as the SHARD has shards.
    
-   SPLITS are uniform contracts and don't have any additional functions (splits maintain equal value even if they come from a different SHARD in the same SHARDS contract)
    

  

Example of a DaApp with SHARDS:

SHARDS (XRC100) & SPLITS (XRC101) allow Developers to sell portions of their DApps by allowing a simple means of retrieving profitable applications that reside on the XDC network while investors can invest in DApp growing a user base while being attributed dividends. The value of the Tokens are based on the performance of a DApp and any DApp no matter how big or small can have SHARDS to allocate profits and sell stake in DApp.

  

SPLITS are a uniform contract to split SHARD tokens into smaller dividend tokens who redeem and split the dividends allocated to that associated Token provided to the SPLIT contract.SPlits are functionally identical to SHARD except they can only represent split ownership of a SHARD where a SHARD is equitable ownership in a DApp. If a Dapp uses the SHARD tokens as governance tokens or used in some automation SPLITS cannot participate, SPLITS only redeem dividends the the SHARD that's been split, account.

  

SPLITS can be broken up into generations the original SHARD stands as Generation 0 while the first SPLIT is generation 1, each generation's SPLITS are equal in value to all SPLITS in that generation. SPLIT generation's allow for SHARDS to be broken up smaller indefinitely. If a DApp has 1000 SHARDs each SHARDS SPLIT has to have the same As the total Shards so each SHARD will be split 1000 times, the first generation SPLITS will have a maximum of 1M SPLITS at 1000 SPLITS per SHARD, and a second generation SPLIT will have a max of 1B SPLITS at a 1000 SPLITS per generation 1 SPLIT and a Trillion SPLITS for generation 3.

  
  

DApps can be SHARD in a few ways. DApps that a build can be built with shards to allow for dividend allocation in these DApps, developers can also build more smart contracts after the fact that can offer more functionality and consolidate the profits from the new DApps into the original SHARD contract. 3rd party developers can also do this to add functionality and increase the Yield for the SHARDS by creating new functions. Developers can also create abstract single function contracts [ex: polling DApp, analysis DApp, TAx DApp] called DApplets that are isolated DApps that aren't typically user facing and may allow functionality to other smart contracts that can hold SHARDS and justify profitability from otherwise abstract functions.

  

Currently crypto currencies are the primary market on blockchain but as more DApps have means of ownership over the DApp new markets will arise centered around the popularity and growth of DApps on the network and as DApps incestuestly interconnect with each secondary DApps that rely on Dependency functions from primary DApps, as the secondary DApps become popular and profitable so do the primary DApps and the SHARD holders of both are able to gain fees on the usage of their contract.

  

SHARDs are build to be DApp the standard for XDC applications to allow DApps to distribute incoming funds amongst a set of token holders who hold as ownership of the DApp and its dividends and allows Developers, investors, and DApp users to easily sell and invest in DApps of all sizes getting user growth similar to how companies operate in tradition economies the only difference the DApp is autonomous,the dividends are autonomous, and any one can own a piece of any DApp.

  

Currently the XRC-SHARD & XRC-SPLITS contracts are being submitted to be an official standard on the XDC network to comment on the process or the contracts check out the [XDC-Community](https://github.com/XDC-Community/XDC-Community.github.io) Github to participate in the XDC XIP process.
